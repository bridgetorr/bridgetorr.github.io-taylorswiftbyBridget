                    <h2>Evermore</h2>
                    <p>Evermore is Swift’s 9th studio album and was the second
                        surprise release of 2020. Released in December, multiple
                        songs remark on being heartbroken around the holidays 
                        with lyrics like “they’ll deck the halls that we once
                        walked through” and “the holidays linger like bad perfume, 
                        you can run, but only so far.” Once again, Swift wrote many
                        of these songs from the perspective of others, drawing 
                        inspiration from books and movies. Other tracks on evermore 
                        include stories of young con artists falling in love, 
                        Dorothea, a girl who left her hometown friends to chase 
                        big dreams, a trilogy of marriages gone bad, and even 
                        memories of Swift’s late grandmother. Finally, evermore 
                        is nominated for the 2022 Album of the Year award at the 
                        Grammys. </p>

                    <h2>Folklore</h2>
                    <p>After cutting the Lover era short due to Covid-19,
                        Swift took everyone by storm and released a surprise
                        album in July of 2020 in one of her unexplored genres: 
                        Indie/Folk. Written, recorded, and produced in quarantine, 
                        the Folklore stories are mostly fictional- which was new
                        territory for Taylor because she typically writes about
                        her own experiences. Lyrically, what makes Folklore most 
                        unique is a love triangle between three imaginary teenagers. 
                        Each person has their own song- “Betty,” “August,” 
                        and “Cardigan”- in which the thoughts, fears, and regrets 
                        of each are expressed through poetic lyrics and cathartic
                        melodies. Folklore won Taylor her third Album of the Year
                        award at the Grammys. </p>

                    <h2>Lover</h2>
                    <p>The Lover era was an explosion of pastel colors, 
                        sparkly hearts, and themes of love and all it entails.
                        Lover explores all sides and stages of love: infatuation,
                        commitment, anxiety, lust, equality, longing, reconciliation,
                        safety, etc. The order of tracks on Lover is also very
                        intentional, beginning with “I Forgot That You Existed,” 
                        a song about how you can wake up one day and realize that
                        someone or something that used to have power over you no
                        longer does. The final track, “Daylight,” symbolizes 
                        looking away from the darkness that was reputation and 
                        looking toward the light. She chose it as the last track
                        because “it recognizes past damage and pain but shows 
                        that it doesn’t have to define you.” </p>

                    <h2>Reputation</h2>
                    <p>Reputation was Swift’s comeback album. Throughout 2016,
                        Taylor was involved in multiple controversies ultimately
                        leading her to go off the grid for a year. With lead single
                        “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift came back strong by 
                        embracing snake imagery, dark color palettes, and the 
                        concept of a bad “reputation.” Songs on reputation are 
                        her most edgy, as she explored electronic and techno music
                        genres. Critics were not as impressed with this as her 
                        previous work, but the reputation “era” was necessary for 
                        Swift to get back into dominating the mainstream music 
                        scene once again.

                    <h2>1989</h2>
                    <p>1989 has been described by critics as the “perfect pop album.” 
                        By this album, which is named after the year Swift was born, 
                        she was a full blown pop-star. Whether people loved or hated her,
                        they all had an opinion: she was too skinny, she dated too many
                        guys, she was a crazy ex-girlfriend, her friend group was too 
                        exclusive, etc. Nevertheless, these criticisms inspired arguably 
                        the two biggest hits of her career: “Shake It Off” and 
                        “Blank Space.” 1989 also won Swift her second Album of the
                        Year at the Grammys.</p>

                    <h2>Red (Taylor's Version)</h2>
                    <p>Swift has said that “lyrically and sonically, 
                        Red resembles a heart-broken person.” As her hit track 22 
                        puts it, she and her friends were “happy, free, confused and
                        lonely at the same time.” As a result, there is not a specific
                        genre of music on Red, but rather, there is everything from 
                        pop melodies to acoustic rhythms. Swift also did her first
                        collaboration on Red, which was with Ed Sheeran in the track
                        “Everything Has Changed.” More artists were featured on the 
                        recent re-release of Red, including Chris Stapleton on 
                        “I Bet You Think About Me” and Phoebe Bridgers on 
                        “Nothing New.”</p>

                    <h2>Speak Now</h2>
                    <p>After being the subject of some skepticism about her songwriting, 
                        Swift decided to be the only writer on her 3rd album. That’s 
                        right- there were no co-writers on Speak Now. Still in the country 
                        genre, Speak Now is a little more relaxed than Fearless, though 
                        there are still very bubbly tracks like “Mine,” “Speak Now,” and 
                        “Sparks Fly.” However, this album is when fans really got to hear 
                        the first of many heart-wrenching ballads like “Back To December,”
                         “Dear John,” and “Last Kiss.” Swift finished the Speak Now era with
                          a global tour that lasted for more than a year.</p>

                    <h2>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</h2>
                    <p>Swift’s sophomore album is what really put her on the map. 
                        She stuck to her country roots but began to explore the pop 
                        verse with some of her biggest hits to date: “Love Story” and 
                        “You Belong With Me”. Sonically and lyrically, Fearless pushes
                        naive and hopelessly romantic motifs. Nevertheless, these daydreams
                        might have been the reason they resonated with so many young 
                        people around the globe. Additionally, Fearless was the first 
                        album Swift re-recorded on her quest to reclaim her music for 
                        herself after it was bought out from under her. More on that 
                        in Recent News. Finally, Fearless won Swift her first Album 
                        of the Year at the Grammys.</p>

                    <h2>Debut</h2>
                    <p> Taylor Swift’s self-titled debut album came out in October 2006
                         when she was just 16 years old. Her first single, “Tim McGraw,” 
                         gave indication that she would start her music career in the 
                         Country genre- a natural beginning for her considering she moved 
                         to Nashville when she was 12 to pursue country music. Though her
                        journey as a songwriter was just beginning, she showed incredible
                        potential in these lyrics by being the sole writer on hit tracks
                        like “Our Song.” Swift never toured for this album, but she
                        still plays these beloved tunes in concerts today.</p>
