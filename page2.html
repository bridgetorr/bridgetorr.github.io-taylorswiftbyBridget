                    <h2>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</h2>
                    <p>Swift’s sophomore album is what really put her on the map. 
                        She stuck to her country roots but began to explore the pop 
                        verse with some of her biggest hits to date: “Love Story” and 
                        “You Belong With Me”. Sonically and lyrically, Fearless pushes
                        naive and hopelessly romantic motifs. Nevertheless, these daydreams
                        might have been the reason they resonated with so many young 
                        people around the globe. Additionally, Fearless was the first 
                        album Swift re-recorded on her quest to reclaim her music for 
                        herself after it was bought out from under her. More on that 
                        in Recent News. Finally, Fearless won Swift her first Album 
                        of the Year at the Grammys.</p>
