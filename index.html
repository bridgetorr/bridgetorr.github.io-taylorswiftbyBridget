        <p>Taylor Swift is a successful business woman,
          songwriter, performer, singer, and most recently, 
          director. She has been in the music industry for
          nearly 20 years, getting her first record deal 
          as a young teenager in Nashville. Since then, 
          Swift has explored many different genres of music;
          however, her poignant songwriting is what resonates
          with so many fans across the world. Swift has 9 
          studio albums, the first 6 of which she is
          rerecording to regain ownership of her work. </p>
