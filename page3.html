            <p>Our coming-of-age has come and gone, suddenly the
              summer it's clear. I never 
              had the courage of my convictions, as long 
              as danger is near. And it's just around the
              corner darling, 'cause it lives in me. No,
              I could never give you peace.</p>

            <p>All the king's horses and all the king's men 
              couldn't put me together again. 'Cause all of my enemies 
              started out friends, help me hold on to you. I've been the archer,
              I've been the prey. Screaming who could ever leave me, darling?
              But who could stay?

            <p>My castle crumbled overnight, I brought a knife to 
              a gun fight, they took the crown but it's alright. All 
              the liars are calling me one, nobody's heard from me 
              for months, I'm doing better than I ever was.

            <p>Miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right. And 
              how you held me in your arms that September night, the first time
              you ever saw me cry. Maybe this wishful thinking, probably mindless 
              dreaming, if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.

              you can't blame it on my youth, and roll your eyes with affection.
              And my cheeks are growin' tired, from turnin' read and fakin' smiles,
              are we only bidin' time 'til I lose your attention?
